#### **Project introduction**  
The scene map in the game includes three types: Island, mountain and plain. Players can choose the conditions of the map to create the map. Players fight in the map, the map is an important part of the game. There are three kinds of terrain in the map, which are mountain, flat land and water area. Buildings can be built on the flat land. Mountains can be used as a natural defense barrier. There may be naval battles in the waters. There may be mining sites in some areas. Players can direct mining vehicles to the mining sites.
Players can form arms and plan routes before fighting. At the beginning, players only have the field of vision in the base, and there is no small map. They have to build radar or air finger to get a small map containing fog. Unit Pathfinder, spy satellite and psychic sensor can remove the fog. In addition to the effect of the crack generator, once the mist is removed, it is permanently visible. The fog generated by the crack generator can only be removed by unit pathfinding. If the enemy comes to scout, the crack will disappear in the enemy's field of vision, and the crack will be re created after the enemy leaves.The game uses ini format files and registry files to store a large number of unit information in arms, vehicles and buildings, and each unit information is stored with INI file.
