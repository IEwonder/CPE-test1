####**Official introduction**
At the end of the Second World War, the Allies began to gain the upper hand. Traditional heavy tanks proved useless in the face of Allied aircraft and flexible tanks. Therefore, Soviet engineers began to design a truly unstoppable tank, which could directly face the enemy's most powerful firepower and annihilate the enemy. Unfortunately, before this kind of "Super Tank" was put into production, the Soviet Union was defeated. The blueprint of the vehicle was quickly hidden, and all prototypes were destroyed, in case the Allies gained more technical advantages. After the Soviet Union got rid of the Allied Occupation, the plan of "Super Tank" was not forgotten. The research and development of this project continued steadily until the tank was finally completed and ready for production in war factories across the Soviet Union.
After that, however, people found that the cost performance of this giant beast, known as the Apocalypse Tank, was not high. Although it has amazing firepower and good mobility, its actual combat performance is no more effective than the modern magnetic energy tank, or even the Latin Union's "poor version Super Tank" - disaster tank. As a result, the Apocalypse Tank was ordered to retire. Although they can still be seen in some large Soviet bases, they are no longer in production. Some Soviet generals still keep a small number of Apocalypse Tanks, but only for the memorial and symbolic significance of these tanks. Rumor has it that some remote-controlled versions of the Apocalypse Tanks are still kept in an unknown place.
Apocalypse Tanks are equipped with two 125mm MAG cannons, which are lethal to any armored unit or building. This tank is also equipped with a large number of "mammoth teeth" missiles, so that this beast class war machine can effectively counter the air force and infantry. Apocalypse Tank fully embodies the tactical idea of "full fire", once it encounters the enemy, it will launch all weapons. The turret of the Apocalypse Tank is strong and rotatable, which allows it to attack accurately while moving.
