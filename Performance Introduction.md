## Ability Analysis
edit
MVP: sky lift tank HP800, shooting speed 5.3, killing 100
3-star sky launch tank hp1200, shooting speed 3.2, killing 200  
Capability analysis: Tianqi tank is also the most valuable weapon (MVP) in the whole Red Alert 2, which can strike the sky and hit the ground, and has strong killing power
In the middle and late stage, we should pay attention to the use of MVP. For skystart tanks, they can be used as core units, and the number should not exceed 10% of the total force value  
The above is from the "towards the palace of Master - the full strategy of tank battle of red police" of a certain expert. There may be errors for reference only [1]
Some experts said that the ultimate rule of Soviet army to attack Soviet army is mining car and Tianqi processing soldier. Mining car is used for engineers and soldiers. Tianqi is because it is more radiation resistant than rhinoceros, and can be used for repair. It is mainly used for mining vehicles. Engineers are able to stand up and fight for Tianqi once they are deployed. There are many mining vehicles specially for spiders and engineers. You can also take a base car to replace mine with whistle ring gun Car [2]  
The earliest source is because of the long-term, difficult to find, but also for reference only.  
Another expert commented that: sky air defense is a device, although the effect on the building is good, but how slow it can not move attacks, Tianqi is a kind of weapon rarely used online.  
Many years ago, Tianqi was a popular unit in cyber warfare, but with the improvement of technology theory, Tianqi was abandoned by the master group several years ago.

Sky Qi has the most powerful firepower and armor, but because of its flexibility, it is the chicken rib for many masters.  
But it is still necessary to analyze its advantages.
As a place occupied by Tianqi is the same as a rhino tank, the price ratio (occupied place) is 1:2, and Tianqi can form local advantages and concentrate fire. (rhinoceros are huge in formation and cannot be fully involved in the war. Imagine that the rhinoceros behind can not fight the enemy and can not help but have no choice. However, the number of Tianqi is less and the number of rhinoceros is less and the number of people involved in the battle is the same. Tianqi is the dominant one. Therefore, it is absolutely very powerful in "large-scale" tank war. This is a big advantage of Tianqi, some called "land occupation" advantages. Combined with other advantages due to high HP and other conditions, it is not easy to say "hard work" (face-to-face tank war). Therefore, Tianqi is often the most popular among many novices.
Unfortunately, the slow speed of Tianqi and the inability to move attacks are its fatal weakness, which causes many adverse consequences to be said little, and it is also the main reason why it is not reused by many masters as "chicken ribs".
(it is necessary to note that the production process is only a little slower in Yuri revenge than rhinoceros, and the speed of the muzzle of Tianqi tank is the same as rhino.) [Back to main page](https://github.com/IEwonder/CPE-test1/blob/main/README.md)
